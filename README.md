###### :dart: In this article we are going to deploy "WordPress" which is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP on top of AWS EC2 Instance!

###### :dart: As WordPress is a frontend application it requires a database to store its data. So we will use MySQL Database Server as a backend database for WordPress and MySQL will be setup using Amazon RDS. 

###### :dart: Finally, we will provide the endpoint of MySQL to WordPress for connectivity.
