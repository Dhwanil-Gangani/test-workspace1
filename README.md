###### :dart: In this article we are going to deploy "WordPress" which is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP on top of AWS EC2 Instance!

###### :dart: As WordPress is a frontend application it requires a database to store its data. So we will use MySQL Database Server as a backend database for WordPress and MySQL will be setup using Amazon RDS. 

###### :dart: Finally, we will provide the endpoint of MySQL to WordPress for connectivity.

## :beginner: TASK DESCRIPTION:

###### :white_check_mark: Configure the instance with Apache Webserver.

###### :white_check_mark: Download php application name "WordPress".

###### :white_check_mark: As wordpress stores data at the backend in MySQL Database server. Therefore, you need to setup a MySQL server using AWS RDS service using Free Tier.

###### :white_check_mark: Provide the endpoint/connection string to the WordPress application to make it work.
